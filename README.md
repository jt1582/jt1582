Hello, my name is James, and my journey into the world of software development started early. I still remember the excitement of writing my first lines of code in Lua Language on Roblox Studio, where I realized the power of logic and creativity coming together. Since then, programming has become more than just a skill, becoming a passion that has shaped my career and aspirations.

Throughout my academic career at University of llinois at Chicago, I’ve dived deep into various coding languages and projects, becoming proficient in ##C/C++, Java##, and building motion graphic designs in Adobe After Effects. 

Looking ahead, I’m eager to expand my expertise further by exploring game development and am always excited about learning skills and applying them in creative ways.

Coursework: Data Structures, Program Design II, Programming Practicum
